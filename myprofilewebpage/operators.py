# % modulo operator

print(10 % 3)

# Assigment operators - increment operator +=1

# Comparison operators
# comparison operators result to boolean value
# > greater than >= greater than or equal to
# < less than <= less than or equal to
# == this represent equals
# != not equal to

# logical Operator
# these are used when you have more than one condition
# 290 >= 300 and 70 >= 60
# False and False = False
# True and True....= True      is even a single False is introduced no matter how many True it will False
# And --- all of the condition need to evaluate ti true for it to be true
# Or ----
# True or True = True
# True or False = True
# False or False or Fa..... = False
#
print(290 >= 300)

# Not -- changes  to the opposite
