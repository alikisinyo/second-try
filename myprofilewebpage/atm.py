# creating a new class
# read on principle of OOP
# a constructor is a special method every time you instantiate a class
class Bank:
    name = "Equity"


# class ATMCard(Bank):
#     # this is a class variable/data member
#     color = "Brown"
#     balance = 0
#
#     def __init__(self, op_balance):
#         self.balance = op_balance
#
#     def deposit(self, amount):
#         self.balance += amount
#         print("Deposited ", amount)
#
#     def withdraw(self, amount):
#         if self.balance < amount:
#             print("Sorry Insufficient")
#         else:
#             self.balance -= amount
#             print("Success: {} ".format(amount))
#
#         self.balance -= amount

# a class variable is shared among all instances of class
# actions are called methods in python these are just function only that they are inside a class
